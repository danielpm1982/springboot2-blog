[**Description of this repository**]<br>
This is a Blog application developed with Spring Boot 2, along with Maven, Spring 5 Core, Spring 5 MVC, Spring 5 Data JPA, Project Lombok, H2-DB, JUnit 5, Mockito, Thymeleaf, HTML 5 and CSS (maybe Bootstrap Framework as well). The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to leverage the most from the inversion of control and dependency injection of Spring 5 / Spring Boot 2 in a Maven MVC Web Application, while taking advantage of the auto-generated repositories of Spring Data JPA and also eliminating boilerplate code with Project Lombok, ultimately aiming to create the most maintainable, easily extensible and cleanest code as possible. All tests are created with Junit 5 and Mockito Testing Frameworks. Test-Driven Development (TDD), as well as Devops CI/CD and Agile best pratices, with continuous integration (CI) and continuous testing, are adopted through GitHub / CircleCI (see status badge from CircleCI above). This application is not deployed anywhere yet, so continuous delivery (CD) is not configured at this moment, but Cloud instances can be set for deployment easily, and eventually will be.

The backlog for this project is simulated through the sequence of its GitHub issues, and respective referred commits, available at:
https://github.com/danielpm1982/springboot2-blog/issues?q=is%3Aissue .

This repository is a single-project repo with Git version control.

Some of my repositories are for backup only, each of them being a collection of tens of projects inside one same repo (with no individual version control for each project), and others are single-project repositores (with effective version control for that single project). As a distinction between them, the backup repos are named in uppercase with underscores (e.g. SPRING3) while the single-project ones are named in lowercase with dashes (e.g. springboot2-ac-di).
